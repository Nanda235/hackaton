STATMENT:

 Violence detection in crowded environment for public safety using Lstm networks

 SOLUTION:

 With the heavy boom in the it industry everyone is moving to the cities or metropolitan cities where the saftey is the major concern.for that we are proving and extension for the cc cameras in public to indentify the voilance it will recognize it but our body moments and hand gestures.
 
At the heart of our solution lies the power of technology, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These neural networks have revolutionized the field of sequence modeling, enabling us to analyze complex data patterns over time

Our solution provides a proactive approach to address this challenge. By continuously analyzing video feeds from surveillance cameras, our LSTM-powered system can detect patterns indicative of violent behavior, such as aggressive movements or altercations, in real-time.
